# Representation-of-text-document-using-wordnet-and-lexical-chains

## Objectives
* Perform Word Sense Disambiguation to identify which sense/concept of a    word is  used in a document.
* Constructing lexical chains using the concepts.

## Scope
To represent semantic content of the document using lexical chains
* We use documents with limited number of words. If the number of word senses increases the complexity of the graph is also increase.
* Building lexical chains using word sense instead of words which gives clues about the theme of a document.

## Modules
* Word sense disambiguation
* Building lexical chains
